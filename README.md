# Machine Learning Algorithms Collection

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of seven different machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and extensibility. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how each algorithm works, making it easier for learners and practitioners to grasp their underlying mechanics.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**
   - A simple algorithm to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - A classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, making use of the logistic function.

3. **Decision Tree**
   - A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. It models decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure.

4. **Random Forest**
   - An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane which maximizes the margin between the different classes.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression by finding the most similar data points in the training set.

7. **K-Means Clustering**
   - An unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.


Each folder contains the implementation of the respective algorithm along with a dedicated README file explaining its usage, parameters, and example code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Algorithms

Each algorithm can be run independently. Navigate to the respective directory and execute the Python script. For example, to run the Linear Regression algorithm:

```bash
cd Linear_Regression
python linear_regression.py
```
